# DESIGN.md — The Directory

A curated collection of DESIGN.md files, templates, and resources for AI coding agents.

**DESIGN.md** is a plain-text design system file that tells AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Bolt, v0, Lovable, Kiro) how to generate UI with consistent visual direction instead of generic defaults.

## What makes a good DESIGN.md?

A useful DESIGN.md should include:

- **Color tokens** with clear roles (primary, surface, border, muted) and exact hex values.
- **Typography scale** with font families, weights, sizes, and usage context.
- **Spacing and radius rules** that map to real UI decisions.
- **Component guidance** for buttons, cards, forms, navigation, and empty states.
- **Layout principles** covering density, rhythm, responsive behavior, and hierarchy.
- **Do / don't rules** that prevent common AI-generated UI mistakes.
- **Agent instructions** that tell the model exactly how to apply the file.

## Example structure

```md
---
name: Product Design System
colors:
  primary: "#635BFF"
  background: "#FFFFFF"
  surface: "#F6F9FC"
  border: "#E3E8EE"
  text-primary: "#0A2540"
  text-secondary: "#425466"
typography:
  heading: "system-ui, sans-serif"
  body: "system-ui, sans-serif"
  mono: "SFMono-Regular, monospace"
spacing:
  base: "8px"
radius:
  card: "12px"
  button: "8px"
  input: "8px"

# Product Design System

## Visual Direction

Describe the visual personality, density, and hierarchy in 2–3 sentences.

## Color System

| Token | Value | Usage |

| --primary | #635BFF | CTAs, links, focus rings |
| --bg | #FFFFFF | Page background |
| --surface | #F6F9FC | Cards, panels |
| --border | #E3E8EE | Borders, dividers |

## Components

Define buttons, cards, forms, navigation, and common states with inline Tailwind or CSS.

## Agent Instructions

Tell the model exactly how to apply this design system. Be specific about typography, spacing, and color usage.

## Don't

List the top 4–6 anti-patterns to avoid for this specific visual style.
